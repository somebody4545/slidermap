It was possible due to the consistent monsoon winds in the area and grew because of the many merchants and cities. It contributed to the spread of trade, such as gold, spices, silk, and slaves, as well as the spread of different cultures from different parts of the world. This increased wealth and cultural awareness, establishing a cooperative relationship between numerous the places across the world, helping establish the world we live in today. ",

This means that for most of the journey, ships don't have to deal with inconsistent wind. <br><br>This caused a small challenge, as traders now had to wait for the winds to go the other direction before sailing back home. This meant round-trip voyages would take many months. Due to it lengthening time before leaving, it also helped with the spread of cultures, as they likely shared some of their own during their time there.",

It is extracted from the husk of the coconut, which must be separated from the fruit via retting, which is burying it in the earth to rot. Next, it is beaten to separate the fibers, then washed and dried. Coir has many uses, but it is seen as very important mostly because of its strength for making ropes and the resistance of rotting in water. The ropes’ thickness ranges from being as thick as a finger to as thick as a person’s arm. Because of this, it can be used to carry very heavy weights. It will also be used for fishnets, as it doesn’t rot in water. Additionally, coir was very beneficial for navigating the Indian Ocean. It helped lift the sails needed for navigating and moving the ship, and were used in place of nails to hold the planks on the ship together. This was very important to the Indian Ocean trade, as coir didn’t rust in the ocean like nails, allowing for more flexibility throughout stormy and shallow waters.",

		"Iron is a very hard metal, but it has some downsides. For one, it is very brittle or easily broken. Iron is similar to other metals, such as gold, silver, tin, and copper for its need for extreme heat. This required technology for making longer and hotter fires, which caused a lot of experimentation, eventually leading to the invention of steel. To make steel, people had to develop a special way of creating iron. They had to add certain pieces to the recipe, resulting in a more heated iron that’s fused with carbon particles. They then produced and exported blocks of steel to places like Persia and Damascus, which was then turned into blades. The steel was so fine and amazing that many people in the 12th century commented on the steel being impossible to surpass in terms of its sharpness and edge. ",
